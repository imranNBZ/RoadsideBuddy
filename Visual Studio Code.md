# Capstone Project 1 (Purpose)

In this project, I have decided to create an application that allows clients to request services for their vehicles when it's broken down on the road.

The idea is to make an Imagenary LLC company that provides roadside services, which includes: 

1. Battery services: We allow clients to request the services through the app with features that allow users to track the driver and secure chat through the application. The battery service will include jump start and battery replacement at two different prices.

2. Tire change: With a tire change, we again allow clients to track drivers and offer options for patching a tire or filling it with air.

And like these two services and so on...


I will create an API for the application, with external APIs for tracking and secure chat with the driver. I may also create an external API for creating an account that allows clients to add personal information.


Additional features that will make the app outstanding:


1. Emergency SOS:

Add an SOS feature for emergency roadside assistance requests with the highest priority response.


2. Service Ratings and Reviews:

Allow clients to rate their experience and leave feedback for drivers.

3. Multiple Payment Options:

Include credit/debit cards, digital wallets, and cash-on-delivery options.

4. Service History:

Let users view their service history for past assistance, costs, and feedback.

5. Driver Profile Display:

Show driver details (name, experience, rating) for client trust.


6. Push Notifications:

Notify users about driver status updates and service completion.


Third-Party APIs:
