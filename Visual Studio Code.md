# Capstone Project 1 (Purpose)

For this project, I have decided to create an application that allows clients to request services for their vehicles when they break down on the road. I will focus mainly on the back end of the project.

I will create a mobile app and website that provide roadside services. Clients can request services using their phones or computers.

My goal is for it to be an app equipped with options of services that allow users to request services like tire change, battery services, or lockout.

The users can request the services below, which allow them to track drivers and get an ETA.

1. Battery services: We allow clients to request the services through the app with features enabling users to track the driver and secure chat through the application. The battery service will include jump start and battery replacement at two different prices.

2. Tire change: With a tire change, we again allow clients to track drivers and offer options for patching or filling a tire with air.

And like these two services and so on...


I will create an API for the application, with external APIs for tracking and secure chat with the driver. I may also make an external API for creating an account that allows clients to add personal information.


Additional features that will make the app outstanding:


1. Emergency SOS:

Add an SOS feature for emergency roadside assistance requests with the highest priority response.


2. Service Ratings and Reviews:

Allow clients to rate their experience and leave feedback for drivers.

3. Multiple Payment Options:

Include credit/debit cards, digital wallets, and cash-on-delivery options.

4. Service History:

Let users view their service history for past assistance, costs, and feedback.

5. Driver Profile Display:

Show driver details (name, experience, rating) for client trust.


6. Push Notifications:

Notify users about driver status updates and service completion.


Third-Party APIs:
